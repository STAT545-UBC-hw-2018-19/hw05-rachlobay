## The goals of the HW05:

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
- Make a plotly visual.
